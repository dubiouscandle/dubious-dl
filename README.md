# dubious-dl
dubious-dl is a simple deep learning library made by a high school student (me!) who thought somehow this would be a productive use of their time. For some reason they really wanted to learn how deep learning worked but instead spent countless hours debugging.

It covers the basics like layers, activations, optimizers, and loss functions in a way that's easy to read and modify.

Hopefully, whether you're learning for the first time or building your deep learning models from scratch, dubious-dl can help you in some way.

Also be warned that there might be mistakes.
