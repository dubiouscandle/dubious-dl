# java-deep-learning
java-deep-learning is a simple deep learning library made by a high school student (me!) who somehow thought that this would be a productive use of their time. For some reason they really wanted to learn how deep learning worked but instead spent countless hours debugging.

It covers the all basics like layers, activations, optimizers, and loss functions and stuff.

Hopefully, whether you're learning for the first time or building your deep learning models from scratch, dubious-dl can help you in some way.

Also be warned that there might be mistakes.
