# dubious-dl
dubious-dl is a simple deep learning library made by a high school student (me!) who wanted to really understand how deep learning worked.

It covers the basics like layers, activations, optimizers, and loss functions in a way that's easy to read and modify.

Hopefully, whether you're learning for the first time or building your deep learning models from scratch, dubious-dl can help you in some way.
